title: Learning Go First Impressions
---

My background in programming has mainly been Python and various web front-ends like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Recently I've been trying to learn new languages like C/C++, Rust and now Go. I also plan to work on my Java skills in the near future.

Throughout the journey I will be using [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to learn the basics of Go. This blog post will simply be my first impressions on the language based on the first 2 modules (Introduction & Variables).

## Things I Like

Quick access to the documentation for packages via the `go doc` command. This is something that I wished every language offered so that I can quickly pull up a function for something. The example that is provided by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) is to pull up the usage of `fmt.Println` by using `go doc fmt.Println`.

Being able to use `go run` run to test an application instead of compiling it first and then having to type `./programName` is like the best of both worlds. Utilizing the convenience of Python while offering the distribution of program file when you use `go build`.

Go has an unused error that will let you know when a variable or package is... unused. This serves as a warning flag for possibly misused or misspelled variables and has the added benefit of a reduced program size if the variable or package in question isn't needed. 

No line delimiters, this point is simple... I don't like having to add a semicolon at the end of every line.

Variable type declaration is optional since Go will infer the type. Another easy to understand point, I love Python specifically for this reason. Inferred variables are a blessing.

The `fmt.Println` function supports adding multiple objects in a single line simply by comma separating them. This has an added benefit of automatically adding a space between the variables or text.

## Things I Don't Like

Not much that I don't like about Go yet. My one pet peeve so far has been the `import` feature. The way it is written feels very foreign to me and I keep tripping on it. Putting the package inside of the quotes doesn't feel right and putting the alias before the package name is even worst.

On the topic of imports, having to import everything. This makes me feel like my code isn't neat and organized, like its a mess. Basic functions like `fmt.Println` should just be a built in, I shouldn't have to import them. The reason Go does it this way is because it more like C than Python. It's aimed at making optimized code not an all-in-one.

## Conclusion

My first impression of Go has been that it is easy to pickup coming from a Python background with some C knowledge. The Language is definitely something that I will be adding to my repertoire of coding knowledge and will probably come in hand with my pen-testing/hacking hobby.

I will probably split the the entire [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) lesson into 3 parts and make a post after each one. Keep an eye on this post or on the home page for when those posts come out.

```bash
./test.sh
