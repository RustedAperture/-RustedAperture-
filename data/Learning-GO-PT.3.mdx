title: Learning GO Pt.3
---

I’m really bad with routine which probably explains why I do so well in environments that are always changing. Months have passed since I last wrote about my journey learning GO.  My last post covered the basics of the language and this one will explore the idea of functions. Functions allow you to organize your code to the simplest degree, allowing you to call code that would otherwise be repeated multiple times.
## Functions

Functions in Go are different then what I’m used to with python, as they include the return variable type in the declaration, similar to C. Returning a value does not auto cast the variable type to the return. This means the return of a function is always limited to the type originally declared.

```GO
func isItLate() string {
	var lateMessage string
	...
	return lateMessage
}
```

In the above example the return does not grab the type from the variable but instead from the function declaration. Similarly the arguments need to be passed a variable typed following their declaration instead of passing the original variable type. When needing to return multiple variables we can declare them in an array. when they are returned you can assign them to multiple values at once. The example below demonstrates this.

```Go
func getLikesAndShares(postId int) (int, int) {
	var likesForPost, sharesForPost int
	...
	return likesForPost, sharesForPost
}

func main() {
	var likes, shares int
	likes, shares = getLikesAndShares(4)
}
```

Above we can see that the function declarations has two returns of int and they are unpacked after the return into two separate variables.

There is a function that is taught known as `defer` I would love to write more about it but I can’t think of a reason yet to use it. What this does is delays the code till the end of the function.

## Conclusion

This concludes my journey into the basics of Go. There is definitely more to learn as I’ve only scratched the surface. I will probably do my long time tradition of rewriting my “text Wars” game in a newly learned language. For now, goodbye and write soon (I hope).
